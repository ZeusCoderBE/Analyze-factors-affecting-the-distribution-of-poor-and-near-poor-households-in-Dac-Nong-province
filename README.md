## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources:** Data was collected from multiple websites related to Đắk Nông province and extracted from a software platform managing poor/near-poor households.
- **Preprocessing:** After gathering the data, extensive preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure data consistency and readiness for analysis. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing relevant metrics.

## Key Factors Affecting Poverty Distribution
1. **Age:** Age distribution reveals specific challenges for different age groups, notably highlighting the high poverty rates among the elderly.
2. **Ethnicity:** Certain ethnic groups exhibit higher poverty rates, emphasizing the need for targeted support programs.
3. **Gender:** Gender-based analysis shows a higher percentage of females in poverty, likely influenced by early marriage rates and limited access to stable employment for women.

## Visualization and Analysis
Data analysis and visualization were conducted using **Python** and **Power BI**, which enabled in-depth insights into the factors contributing to poverty distribution. Various plots and charts were generated to visualize the distribution across demographic and socioeconomic variables.
